  abstract = "Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq is one of the most
              commonly performed bioinformatics analyses. Transcript-level
              quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level
              read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to
              transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned
              unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with
              multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with
              many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level
              differential expression do not perform optimally on transcript
              counts because the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts
              the mean-variance relationship normally observed for gene level
              RNA-seq data and interferes with the efficiency of the empirical
              Bayes dispersion estimation procedures. The pseudoaligners
              kallisto and Salmon provide bootstrap samples from which
              quantification uncertainty can be assessed. We show that the
              overdispersion arising from RTA can be elegantly estimated by
              fitting a quasi-Poisson model to the bootstrap counts for each
              transcript. The technical overdispersion arising from RTA can
              then be divided out of the transcript counts, leading to scaled
              counts that can be input for analysis by established gene-level
              software tools with full statistical efficiency. Comprehensive
              simulations and test data show that an edgeR analysis of the
              scaled counts is more powerful and efficient than previous
              differential transcript expression pipelines while providing
              correct control of the false discovery rate. Simulations explore
              a wide range of scenarios including the effects of paired vs

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complications significantly augment
              the overall COVID-19 mortality, largely due to the susceptibility
              of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) to SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2
              virus encodes 27 genes, whose specific impacts on CM health are
              not fully understood. This study elucidates the deleterious
              effects of SARS-CoV-2 genes Nsp6, M, and Nsp8 on human CMs.
              METHODS: CMs were derived from human pluripotent stem cells
              (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells and induced
              pluripotent stem cells, using 2D and 3D differentiation methods.
              We overexpressed Nsp6, M, or Nsp8 in hPSCs and then applied whole
              mRNA-seq and mass spectrometry for multi-omics analysis.
              Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry was utilized to map the
              protein interaction networks of Nsp6, M, and Nsp8 within host
              hiPSC-CMs. RESULTS: Nsp6, Nsp8, and M globally perturb the
              transcriptome and proteome of hPSC-CMs. SARS-CoV-2 infection and
              the overexpression of Nsp6, Nsp8, or M coherently upregulated
              genes associated with apoptosis and immune/inflammation pathways,
              whereas downregulated genes linked to heart contraction and
              functions. Global interactome analysis revealed interactions
              between Nsp6, Nsp8, and M with ATPase subunits. Overexpression of
              Nsp6, Nsp8, or M significantly reduced cellular ATP levels,
              markedly increased apoptosis, and compromised Ca2+ handling in
              hPSC-CMs. Importantly, administration of FDA-approved drugs,
              ivermectin and meclizine, could restore ATP levels, thereby
              mitigating apoptosis and dysfunction in hPSC-CMs overexpressing
              Nsp6, Nsp8, or M. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings uncover the
              extensive damaging effects of Nsp6, Nsp8, and M on hPSC-CMs,
              underlining the crucial role of ATP homeostasis in CM death and
              functional abnormalities induced by these SARS-CoV-2 genes, and

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate
              millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
              reference genome. In many applications, the key information
              required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses
              but has so far received relatively little attention in the
              literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read
              summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from
              either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
              implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
              blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing
              methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)

  abstract = "The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in
              designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and
              Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of
              differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment
              using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this
              paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed
              (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray
              experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples.
              The model is reset in the context of general linear models with
              arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach
              applies equally well to both single channel and two color
              microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are
              derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators
              proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays
              and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot
              quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in
              terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual
              standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard
              deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to
              shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled
              estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number
              of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the
              advantage over the posterior odds that the number of
              hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in
              particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes
              are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a
              t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t
              inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite
              null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The
              performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: In RNA-seq differential expression analysis,
              investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in
              expression level across conditions, despite technical and
              biological variability in the observations. A common task is to
              accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a
              logarithmic fold change (LFC). RESULTS: When the read counts are
              low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the
              LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not
              representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by
              effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds
              and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering
              may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true
              differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited
              solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the
