  abstract  = "Data science is increasingly important and challenging. It
               requires computational tools and programming environments that
               handle big data and difficult computations, while supporting
               creative, high-quality analysis. The R language and related
               software play a major role in computing for data science. R is
               featured in most programs for training in the field. R packages
               provide tools for a wide range of purposes and users. The
               description of a new technique, particularly from research in
               statistics, is frequently accompanied by an R package, greatly
               increasing the usefulness of the description. The history of R
               makes clear its connection to data science. R was consciously
               designed to replicate in open-source software the contents of
               the S software. S in turn was written by data analysis
               researchers at Bell Labs as part of the computing environment
               for research in data analysis and collaborations to apply that
               research, rather than as a separate project to create a
               programming language. The features of S and the design decisions
               made for it need to be understood in this broader context of
               supporting effective data analysis (which would now be called
               data science). These characteristics were all transferred to R
               and remain central to its effectiveness. Thus, R can be viewed
               as based historically on a domain-specific language for the
               domain of data science.",

              quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level
              read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to
              transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned
              unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with
              multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with
              many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level
              differential expression do not perform optimally on transcript
              counts because the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts
              the mean-variance relationship normally observed for gene level
              RNA-seq data and interferes with the efficiency of the empirical
              Bayes dispersion estimation procedures. The pseudoaligners
              kallisto and Salmon provide bootstrap samples from which
              quantification uncertainty can be assessed. We show that the

              the overall COVID-19 mortality, largely due to the susceptibility
              of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) to SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2
              virus encodes 27 genes, whose specific impacts on CM health are
              not fully understood. This study elucidates the deleterious
              effects of SARS-CoV-2 genes Nsp6, M, and Nsp8 on human CMs.
              METHODS: CMs were derived from human pluripotent stem cells
              (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells and induced
              pluripotent stem cells, using 2D and 3D differentiation methods.
              We overexpressed Nsp6, M, or Nsp8 in hPSCs and then applied whole
              mRNA-seq and mass spectrometry for multi-omics analysis.
              Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry was utilized to map the
              protein interaction networks of Nsp6, M, and Nsp8 within host
              hiPSC-CMs. RESULTS: Nsp6, Nsp8, and M globally perturb the
              transcriptome and proteome of hPSC-CMs. SARS-CoV-2 infection and
              the overexpression of Nsp6, Nsp8, or M coherently upregulated
              genes associated with apoptosis and immune/inflammation pathways,
              whereas downregulated genes linked to heart contraction and
              functions. Global interactome analysis revealed interactions
              between Nsp6, Nsp8, and M with ATPase subunits. Overexpression of
              Nsp6, Nsp8, or M significantly reduced cellular ATP levels,
              markedly increased apoptosis, and compromised Ca2+ handling in
              hPSC-CMs. Importantly, administration of FDA-approved drugs,
              ivermectin and meclizine, could restore ATP levels, thereby
              mitigating apoptosis and dysfunction in hPSC-CMs overexpressing
              Nsp6, Nsp8, or M. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings uncover the
              extensive damaging effects of Nsp6, Nsp8, and M on hPSC-CMs,
              underlining the crucial role of ATP homeostasis in CM death and

              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses
              but has so far received relatively little attention in the

              either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
              implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature

  abstract = "The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in
              designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and
              Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of
              differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment
              using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this
              paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed
              (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray
              experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples.
              The model is reset in the context of general linear models with
              arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach
              applies equally well to both single channel and two color
              microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are
              derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators
              proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays
              and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot
              quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in
              terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual
              standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard
              deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to
              shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled
              estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number
              of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the
              advantage over the posterior odds that the number of
              hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in
              particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes
              are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a
              t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t
              inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite
              null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The
              performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.

              investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in
              expression level across conditions, despite technical and
              biological variability in the observations. A common task is to
              accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a
              logarithmic fold change (LFC). RESULTS: When the read counts are
              low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the

              representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by

              and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering
              may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true

  title    = "Camera: a competitive gene set test accounting for inter-gene
              correlation",
  author   = "Wu, Di and Smyth, Gordon K",
  abstract = "Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway
              analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation
              category amongst the differential expression results from a
              microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene
              permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to
              inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show
              that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments
              on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model
              organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed
              based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from
              the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An
              efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene
              correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to
              control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene
              correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine
              differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows
              that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes
              in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified
              sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular
              signatures.",

               directional pathway perturbation analysis",

               and Pederson, Stephen M",
  abstract  = "A common outcome of analysing RNA-Seq data is the detection of
               biological pathways with significantly altered activity between
               the conditions under investigation. Whilst many strategies test
               for over-representation of genes, showing changed expression
               within pre-defined gene-sets, these analyses typically do not
               account for gene-gene interactions encoded by pathway
               topologies, and are not able to directly predict the directional
               change of pathway activity. To address these issues we have
               developed sSNAPPY ,now available as an R/Bioconductor package,
               which leverages pathway topology information to compute pathway
               perturbation scores and predict the direction of change across a
               set of pathways. Here, we demonstrate the use of sSNAPPY by
               applying the method to public scRNA-seq data, derived from
               ovarian cancer patient tissues collected before and after
               chemotherapy. Not only were we able to predict the direction of
               pathway perturbations discussed in the original study, but
               sSNAPPY was also able to detect significant changes of other
               biological processes, yielding far greater insight into the
               response to treatment. sSNAPPY represents a novel pathway
               analysis strategy that takes into consideration pathway topology
               to predict impacted biology pathways, both within related
               samples and across treatment groups. In addition to not relying
               on differentially expressed genes, the method and associated R
               package offers important flexibility and provides powerful
               visualisation tools. R version : R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29)
