# A Brief Introduction to R {background-color="#3c3c44" background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png background-size="40%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position='80% 50%'}


## Why use R?

- Heavily used for analysis of biological data (along with Python)
    - Can handle extremely large datasets  
    - Packages explicitly designed for complex analysis
    - Huge user base of biological researchers (www.bioconductor.org)
    - (Can be) very fast
- Very easy to *dynamically interact* with large datasets
    - Can also run as static scripts on HPC clusters
    
::: {.notes}
I regularly work with data containing millions of lines
:::

## Why use R?
    
- **Reproducible Research!!!**
    - Transparent methods
    - Integration with version control such as `git`
- Avoids common Excel pitfalls [(almost) never modify files on disk!]{.fragment}

. . .

Experience is the best teacher $\implies$ please practice your skills

::: {.notes}
- Discuss column sorting
:::

## What is R?

- Derivative of `S` (*John Chambers et al*, Bell Labs 1976)

## What is R?

- Derivative of `S` (*John Chambers et al*, Bell Labs 1976)
- `R` first appeared in 1993
    - **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman (U of Auckland)
    - Disentangled some proprietary `S` code $\implies$ *open-source*
    - `S` ceased development in early 2000s
    - Now estimated >2 million users
    - Nice history article [here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020/RJ-2020-028/RJ-2020-028.pdf)

::: {.notes}
- Ross Ihaka is of NZ Maori descent
- Last commercial release of S-Plus in 2007
:::    
    
## What is R?

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width='75%'}

- Open source language
    + No corporate ownership $\implies$ free software
    + Code is managed by the community of users
- `R` is formally run by a volunteer committee (**R Core**)
    + Mostly academics
    + John Chambers is *still* a member
- Annual release schedule with patches as required
    + Most recent is R 4.4.1 (Jun 14)

:::

::: {.notes}
- Being open source creates headaches for University & Business IT departments
- No guarantees of being virus free. Has inherent security flaws particularly using R data files (which are often part of packages)
- The community self-regulates
- Release Names are references to Peanuts cartoons
:::
    
## R Packages

- Packages are the key to R's flexibility and power
    - Are collections (or libraries) of related functions
    - `ggplot2` $\implies$ Generating plots
    - `edgeR` $\implies$ Differential Gene Expression (DGE) for RNA-Seq 
    
. . .    
    
- $>$ 16,000 packages are stored on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org)
    - Not curated for statistical quality or documentation
    - Automated testing for successful installation

. . .

- Bioconductor is a secondary repository (https://www.bioconductor.org)
    - $>$ 2,200 packages with a more biological/genomics focus
    - Curated for language consistency & documentation
    
::: {.notes}
- The gg in ggplot2 stands for "Grammar of Graphics"
- Crap packages are generally identified by the users and then just not-used
- Statistical rigour is usually checked during review of the accompanying publication
:::
   
## Where is R used? {visibility="hidden"}

- Google, ATO, ABS etc
- Very large community of users in finance (Dirk Eddelbuettel - `Rcpp`)
- Genomics, Ecological Research, Public Health, Politics...
- Strong integration with HPC systems like Amazon, Hadoop
- Growing Machine Learning capacity
- Even has it's own peer-reviewed Journal (The R Journal)


::: {.notes}
- I was offered a position by the ABS in 2022 specifically for my R skills to use analysing the housing market.
- BODL offered me a position the exact same day so I stayed in academia

Much of today is inspired by a two-day developers workshop I attended with Hadley Wickham.
Also gave me an opportunity to have some great conversations with Winston Chang

# Using R {background-color="#3c3c44" background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png background-size="40%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position='70% 50%'}

## The R Console

- Let's try using `R` as a standalone tool $\implies$ open `R` NOT `RStudio`
    + On `linux`: Open a terminal then enter `R`
    + On OSX: Click ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png){width="40px"} on your dock
    + On Windows: Click ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png){width="40px"} in your Start Menu
    
    
- Do not open ![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png){width="100px"} 

![](assets/RTerminal.png){width="50%"}

## The R Console

- This is often referred to as the `R Console` 
- At it's simplest is just a calculator

```{r}
1 + 1
2 * 2
2 ^ 3
```

. . .

- `R` has many standard functions

```{r}
sqrt(2)
log10(1000)
```

. . .

- NB: We placed the value *inside* the brackets *after* the function name

::: {.notes}
I never use a calculator program on my laptop, always R
:::

## The R Console

We can create objects with names

```{r}
x <- 5
```

. . .

- We have just created an object called `x`
- View the contents of the object by entering it's name in the `Console`

```{r}
x
```

. . .

- The `<-` symbol is like an arrow $\implies$ "put the value `5` into `x`"
    - Was a single key on keyboards in the 1970s

. . .

![*An APL Keyboard from the 1970s*](assets/APL-keybd2.png){width=60% fig-align="left"}


## The R Console

- The object `x` only exists in the `R Environment`

. . .

- We can pass objects to functions and perform operations on the

```{r}
x + 1
sqrt(x)
x^2
x > 1
```

## The R Console

- Everything we've just done is trivial
- Real analysis isn't
- If we perform a series of steps
    + Should we keep a copy of what we've done?
    + If so, how should we do that?
    
. . .

- A common strategy is to record our code as an *R Script*
- `R Studio` makes that easy & convenient
