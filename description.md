# RAdelaide 2024

2024 sees the return of the 3-day RAdelaide training event.
The sessions will be in-person only, running from 9am-5pm on the 9^th^ to 11^th^ July, with lunches and morning/afternoon tea provided.
Workshops will be held in The Braggs 4.50, North Terrace Campus, The University of Adelaide.

To ensure accessibility for as many attendees as possible, HEPA filters will be in place and running throughout the workshop, whilst those who choose to wear masks are very welcome.

## Instructors

The training sessions will be led by Dr Stevie Pederson (Black Ochre Data Labs, Telethon Kids Institute), who designed and ran RAdelaide between 2015-2019, and has delivered R workshops to hundreds of attendees both locally and around Australia, within academia, at conferences and in a corporate industry setting.
Stevie has been an R user for over 20 years, and is the primary author and maintainer of 4 R packages (*ngsReports*, *extraChIPs*, *motifTestR* and *transmogR*) with additional contributions to multiple other packages.
As an active member of the wider Bioconductor community, Stevie has also helped organise the international BiocAsia conference from 2016-2019, and is currently a member of the Bioconductor Community Advisory Board.
Their research primarily focuses on transcriptomics and gene regulation as part of the PROPHECY project, investigating Type II Diabetes and complications within the Indigenous Australian community.
Stevie was also Coordinator of the Bioinformatics Hub at the University of Adelaide from 2014-2020.

Additional support will be provided by A/Prof Jimmy Breen, Dr Liza Kretzschmar and Holly Massacci (Black Ochre Data Labs, Telethon Kids Institute), as well as Dr Paul Wang and Dr John Salamon (South Australian Genomics Centre)


## Course Outline

All interested parties are welcome, from raw beginners to those with some experience who are looking to extend their understanding.
The 3-day course will cover the concepts and material listed below.
These sessions will include an introduction to core packages within the `tidyverse` as well as many essential Bioconductor packages for working with genomic and transcriptomic data.

Whilst attendees are welcome to attend specific days as required, the course will be delivered as a whole and the most benefit will be gained from attending all three days.
