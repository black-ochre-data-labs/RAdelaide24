# Enrichment Analysis {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## What is Enrichment Analysis

- Often in transcriptomics and genomics we have large lists of results
- May be genes, genomic positions etc
- How do we interpret these?
    + Should we cherry pick known *high-quality* candidates?
    + Should we try look for patterns within the list?
    
. . .

- Enrichment analysis is one strategy for looking for patterns
    + Network analysis is another approach
- Generally rely on genes can be organised into "gene sets" 
    + Multiple Databases depending on your question
    
## Multiple Approaches

- Take a ranked list of results<br>$\implies$Are gene-sets clustered around either end

. . .

- Are genes from a specific gene-set enriched within significant results
    + Hypergeometric testing
    
. . .

- Can we obtain an overall value of significance for all genes within a gene-set

::: {.notes}
- No method is perfect & all have limitations
- Gene expression also appears to be highly correlated & subject to bias
:::
    
## Gene Ontology

- Gene Ontology (GO) Database https://www.geneontology.org/
- Restricted and highly controlled set of descriptive terms
- Terms are grouped into 3 main categories
    1. Biological Process (BP)
    2. Molecular Function (MF)
    3. Cellular Component (CC)
- Hierarchical interconnected structure within each category


## Gene Ontology

![Taken from https://www.geneontology.org](https://www.geneontology.org/assets/ontology-browse-tree.jpg)

::: {.notes}
- Knowing how to filter results with heavily related terms can be a challenge
- Multiple pruning strategies exist
:::

## Gene Ontology

- An example using the QuickGO tool is [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0002253)

## KEGG

- Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
- Exhaustive list of manually curated pathways
    1. Metabolism
    2. Genetic Information Processing
    3. Environmental Information Processing
    4. Cellular Processes
    5. Organismal Systems
    6. Human Diseases
    7. Drug Development
- Role in pathway (e.g. activation of inhibition) included
    
## KEGG

![https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa04010](assets/kegg_mapk.png){fig-align="left"}

## Other Databases

- WikiPathways is an open-source analog to KEGG
    + https://www.wikipathways.org
- Reactome is highly curated, peer-reviewed database
    + https://reactome.org
    
. . .

- Can also use custom gene-sets
    + Results from an internal study
    + Genes matching custom genomic features
    
## MSigDB

- The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) collects multiple databases
    + https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp
    + Collected simply as gene sets without functional annotation

. . .

- H: Hallmark Gene Sets are unique to MSigDB

## Gene Sets and Pathways in R

- Bioconductor provides multiple packages and tools for obtaining gene sets
    + `GO.db`, `KEGGREST`, `biomaRt`
- My preferred strategy is `msigdbr`
    + Parses MSigDb gene sets as a `tibble`
    + Not really built on existing Bioconductor object classes
- Best annotations are for human/mouse
    
## `msigdbr`

```{r}
#| output-location: column
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(msigdbr)
msigdbr_collections()
```

## `msigdbr`

```{r}
msigdbr_species()
```

## Setting Up An Object

- Let's choose KEGG pathways for our analysis

```{r}
kegg_tbl <- msigdbr(subcategory = "CP:KEGG")
glimpse(kegg_tbl)
```

## Setting Up An Object

- Every mapping between a gene ID and KEGG pathway is here
- Gene IDs are provided using Ensembl (EBI) and EntrezGene (NCBI)
- Gene set IDs match the specific database
- URLs are also provided
    + But can get out of date when databases reconfigure
    
## Comparing To Our Data

::: {style="font-size: 95%;"}

```{r}
res_treatM <- read_rds("data/res_treatM.rds") %>% 
  mutate(ensembl_gene = str_extract(gene_id, "ENSG[0-9]+")) # Remove version numbers
kegg_tbl %>% 
  summarise(
    gs_size = dplyr::n(),
    detected = sum(ensembl_gene %in% res_treatM$ensembl_gene),
    .by = gs_name
  ) %>% 
  mutate(prop_detected = detected / gs_size) %>% 
  arrange(prop_detected)
```

:::

## Comparing To Our Data

- Gene sets should be chosen wisely
    + If few genes from a gene set are detected<br>$\implies$may not be suitable for cell-type under investigation
- Should we restrict gene-sets to genes detected in our data?

. . .

- This can impact the analysis depending on the approach taken

::: {.notes}
- My take is that we should. For enrichment testing then we're comparing changed vs unchanged in the candidate genes. Otherwise, we're confounding detected with changed
:::

## Cleaning The Database

```{r}
kegg_tbl <- kegg_tbl %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    sum(ensembl_gene %in% res_treatM$ensembl_gene) >  0.05 * dplyr::n(),
    .by = gs_name
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    ensembl_gene %in% res_treatM$ensembl_gene
  )
```

## A Cautionary Limitation

- Not all genes are annotated to a gene set or pathway
- Well-studied genes are annotated to gene sets <br>$\implies$ their pathways become interesting <br>$\implies$ studied further<br>$\implies$ rinse & repeat

. . .

```{r}
dplyr::filter(kegg_tbl, gene_symbol == "SNAP91") %>% nrow()
dplyr::filter(kegg_tbl, gene_symbol == "DUSP26") %>% nrow()
```

. . .

- This doesn't mean these genes play an unimportant biological role!

::: {.notes}
- We can only use the available information
- Poorly studied genes can be revelations but take large sums of money
:::

# GSEA {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- GSEA is a formally defined algorithm [@Subramanian2005-lx]
    + Not commonly used in reference to the wider type of analysis
- Doesn't require DEGs $\implies$ uses a ranked list
    + Ranks based on significance only or incorporating direction
    
. . .
    
- Walks along the gene list obtaining a cumulative sum
    + Can be set to start from either end
    + Genes in a gene-set return a +ve score
    + Genes not in a gene-set return a -ve score
- Compared to permuted values to return $p$-values
    + Results can change on repeat runs

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- Can be run as a stand-alone tools
- `R` implementation is `fgsea` [@fgsea2019]
- Requires two inputs
    + A `list` with genes separated by gene set
    + A ranked-list of genes

```{r}
library(fgsea)
kegg_by_gs <- kegg_tbl %>% 
  split(.$gs_name) %>% 
  lapply(pull, "ensembl_gene")
length(kegg_by_gs)
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- To make a directional ranked list
    + Multiply $-\log_{10}p$ by the sign of logFC

```{r}
ranks_treatM <- res_treatM %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = -sign(logFC) * log10(PValue),
    rank = setNames(rank, ensembl_gene)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(rank) %>% 
  pull(rank)
head(ranks_treatM)
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

```{r}
set.seed(101)
gsea_treatM <- fgsea(kegg_by_gs, ranks_treatM)
gsea_treatM %>% arrange(pval)
```

::: {.notes}
- Using `set.seed()` can aid reproducibility as the same random seed is used for permutations
:::

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- Adjusted p-values are FDR-adjusted by default
- Enrichment Score (ES) is the peak value from the cumulative sum
    + ES < 0 $\implies$ result is for genes at the negative end
- Normalised Enrichment Score (NES) normalises across pathways
- The size of the gene set is also given
- The Leading Edge lists the genes more beyond the peak ES
    + Might need to convert to gene names

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- The enrichment score can be seen for any pathway

```{r lysosome-barcode}
plotEnrichment(kegg_by_gs$KEGG_LYSOSOME, ranks_treatM) +
  ggtitle("KEGG_LYSOSOME")
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- Manual inspection can help us decide if we really believe the result
   + GSEA tends *always* find something $\implies$ be conservative with results

```{r all-dir-barcode}
#| output-location: slide
library(patchwork)
gsea_treatM %>% 
  arrange(pval) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(padj < 0.05) %>% 
  dplyr::slice(1:9) %>% # Ensure we don't get more than 9
  pull(pathway) %>% 
  lapply(
    \(x) {
      lab <- str_remove_all(x, "KEGG_")
      plotEnrichment(kegg_by_gs[[x]], ranks_treatM) + ggtitle(lab)
    }
  ) %>% 
  wrap_plots()
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

- A quick summary of the results

```{r}
id2symbol <- kegg_tbl %>% 
  distinct(ensembl_gene, gene_symbol) %>% 
  mutate(gene_symbol = setNames(gene_symbol, ensembl_gene)) %>% 
  pull(gene_symbol)
gsea_treatM %>% 
  arrange(pval) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(padj < 0.05) %>% 
  mutate(leSize = map_int(leadingEdge, length)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(pathway, NES, FDR = padj, size, leSize, leadingEdge) %>% 
  mutate(
    leadingEdge = lapply(leadingEdge, \(x) id2symbol[x])
  )
```

:::

::: {.notes}
- ECM_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION and FOCAL_ADHESION seem to be capturing a similar gene set
:::

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

- This approach has assumed that clustering by direction is biologically relevant
- Implies that up-regulated genes $\implies$ pathway activation
- Ranks can also be prepared using significance only ($-\log_{10}p$)
    + Effectively detects *perturbed* gene sets with genes at both ends

``` r
fgsea(kegg_by_gs, ranks_by_sig, scoreType = "pos")
```
