## Today's Outline

- Not just to show how to perform an RNA-Seq analysis
- Understanding common file types
- Understanding Bioconductor objects, classes & methods
    + Has relevance beyond Bioconductor (e.g. map visualisation)
- Key concepts & resources

. . .

- Please ask questions!!! It's the advantage of being here...

## CRAN

- A Package is a collection of functions
- Associated with a given task/analysis/data-type
- The main repository is "__The Comprehensive R Archive Network__" aka [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)

. . .

- We install packages using `Tools > Install Packages...`
    + Or by typing `install.packages("pkg_name")`
- Will only install packages from CRAN

## CRAN

- Packages on CRAN cover everything & anything
    + GIS-based spatial data, stock trading, data visualisation etc
- Some packages are biological in focus, e.g. `Seurat` for scRNA

. . .

- Submission involves passing technical checks
    + Tests across OSX, Windows & Linux
    + Correct directory/file structures

    
## Packages

- Many packages are written by the authors for the authors
- Decide to make them public in case others find them helpful

. . .

- Both Chris & I use `ngsReports` nearly every day (still...)

![](assets/ngsreports_pub.png)
    
## Bioconductor

- Bioconductor hosts packages focussed on biological research
    + www.bioconductor.org
    + Currently > 2,400 packages
- Created by Robert Gentleman (one of the "R"s in `R`) in 2001

. . .

- Packages checked for programming consistency $\implies$ not methodology
    + Expected to integrate with other Bioconductor packages
- All packages require a vignette explaining how to use the package
    + Checked manually for clarity/helpfulness during package submission
- Packages tested nightly on OSX, Windows, Debian Linux + Arch Linux
    
## Bioconductor

- Essentially represents a *community* of developers & users
- Strongly encourages & supports diversity
    + No longer on Twitter $\implies$ not a safe space
- Has a [Code of Conduct](https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
- Consciously supporting those from emerging countries
    + Actively trying to translate resources to other languages
- Also tries to find ways to engage with & support both developers & users
    + support.bioconductor.org & slack.bioconductor.org
    + Members of R Core regularly post on the Bioconductor slack

    + Generally new features added to packages at Bioc releases
- Latest Bioconductor release is 3.19 (May 1^st^ 2024)
    + Was tested on R 4.4.0

## Bioconductor Package Installation

- `BiocManager()` is a CRAN package
- Enables installation from CRAN *and* Bioconductor
    + Also handles package installation from `github`

``` r
BiocManager::install(c("pkg1", "user/pkg2"))
```

## Bioconductor Packages

- Many packages for specific analyses
    + `DESeq2` & `edgeR` for bulk RNA-Seq Analysis
    + `DiffBind` & `extraChIPs` for ChIP-Seq Analysis
    + `fgsea` for GSEA within `R`

. . .

- Also multiple packages define object classes & general methods
    + e.g. `GenomicRanges` for working with `GRanges` objects
    + Is a foundational class many other packages build on
- New packages are expected to use existing classes where possible

- Inside the `R` directory
    + Will retain comments & formatting from the authors
    + Sometimes more helpful...
    
## BiocViews

- [BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software) provide an overview of all Bioconductor packages
- Can be very helpful when looking for a resource
- Most packages are software (for analysis)
- Also annotation packages:
    + Genome sequences, gene to GO mappings etc
- Experimental data for demonstrating workflows
- Workflow packages are slowly growing

# Object Classes {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Object Classes

R has two common types of objects

- Built on top of (and including) vectors, lists etc.
- `S3` are very common & old (1970s)
    + Usually list-type objects e.g. results from `lm()` or `t.test()`
- `S4` introduced in '90s
    + Focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Biconductor packages rely heavily on `S4` objects
    + Also common in spatial packages on CRAN (i.e. making maps etc)

## Objects and Methods

- Functions can be written to handle different types of input data
- Figuring out which version of the function to use<br>$\implies$*method dispatch*

. . .

- A good example is the function `summary()`
    + Will return different results for a `vector` or `data.frame`

``` r
summary(letters)
summary(cars)
```

. . .

*How does `summary()` know what to do for different data structures?*

## Objects and Methods

- If we try to look at the code used in `summary()` it's a bit odd

```{r}
body(summary)
```

. . .

- `summary()` uses different **methods** depending on the object class
- Sometimes they're hidden [(I don't know why...)]{.fragment}

## Objects and Methods

```{r}
methods(summary)
```

::: {.notes}
The class is given after the dot
Those marked with an asterisk are hidden
:::

## Objects and Methods

- `summary.data.frame()` <br>$\implies$ used when `summary()` is called on a `data.frame`
- `summary.lm()` <br>$\implies$ for an object of class `lm` (produced by `lm()`)
- `summary.prcomp()` <br>$\implies$ for an object of class `prcomp` (produced by `prcomp()`)

. . .

- If no method is written for a class $\implies$ `summary.default()`
- Look inside this using `body(summary.default)`
    + The last couple of lines were the output from `summary(letters)`
    
## Objects and Methods   

- Can also see what methods exist for a given class
- Before loading any packages ~56 methods exist for a data.frame

```{r}
methods(class = "data.frame")
```

## Objects and Methods   

- Loading a new package will often introduce new methods

```{r, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
methods(class = "data.frame")
```

. . .

- Now we have ~170 methods for a data.frame

## Objects and Methods   

- Most classes have a `print()` method
- Determines what to print to the screen when calling an object
- Most common use case for me is `print(my_tbl, n = 20)`
    + Can use to override the default number of rows printed
    + Calls `print.tbl` (which is hidden)

## S3 Objects

- Everything we've just seen applies to `S3` objects
- Very common class type (`data.frame`, `list`, `htest`, `lm` etc)

. . .

- Sometimes classes have an explicit hierarchy
   + Best shown using `is()` instead of `class()`

```{r}
is(band_members)
```

. . .

- `R` looks for `print.tbl_df()` $\rightarrow$  `print.tbl()` $\rightarrow$ `print.data.frame()` etc
- Will use the first one found
- If none found $\implies$ `print.default()`

## S4 Objects

Many Bioconductor Packages define `S4` objects

- Very strict controls on data structure
- Can be frustrating at first
- Use the `@` symbol for "slots" as well as `$` for list elements
    + Slots are strictly defined components
- Methods are also strictly defined

## S4 Objects

- Can be a little more challenging to interact with the `tidyverse`
- Bioconductor pre-dates the `tidyverse` by > 10 years
- `tidyomics` is an active area of Bioconductor development
    + Led by Stefano Mangiola from SAiGENCI
    
. . .

![](assets/tidyomics.png){.absolute left=0 bottom=0 width="740px"}

## S4 Objects

::: {style="font-size: 95%;"}


- Some packages use `S4` implementations of `S3` objects
    + `data.frame` (S3) Vs `DataFrame` (S4)
    + `list` (S3) Vs `List` (S4)
    + `vector` (S3) Vs `Vector` (S4)
    + `rle` (S3) Vs `Rle` (S4)
    
::: {.incremental}

- Many are written for memory efficiency
- Look and behave similarly, but can ocassionally trip you over
    + Object may require a `DataFrame` and you have a `data.frame`
    + Coercion is usually relatively simple between base-level classes

:::

:::

::: {.notes}
Many S4 objects & methods were developed in the days when compute resources were limited
:::

## Rle Vectors

- These are Run-Length Encoded vectors

```{r}
library(S4Vectors)
test <- c(rep("X", 10), rep("Y", 5))
test
Rle(test)
```

- Can encode millions of chromosomes with minimal memory
    + Sorting can help keep memory useage down

# Variations on `data.frame` Objects  {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## `data.frame` Objects

- `data.frame`
    1. Can set `rownames`
    2. Dumps all data to your screen
    3. Cannot have column names with spaces

. . .

- `tibble` aka `tbl_df`
    1. `rownames` are always `1:nrow(df)` 
    2. Prints a summary with rownames hidden
    3. Column names with spaces permitted
    4. My preferred `data.frame` type


## `DataFrame` objects

``` r
?DataFrame
```

- An `S4` version
    + Doesn't work with the `tidyverse` (`dplyr`, `ggplot2` etc)
    + Still missing from `tidyomics`

::: {.fragment}
    
- Until 2021 couldn't coerce to a `tibble` directly
- I hated that so wrote `as_tibble()` for `DataFrame` objects
    + In the package `extraChIPs`
    + Enables passing `S4` objects to `ggplot()`
    + Please test & find any bugs I haven't found yet
    
:::

## `DataFrame` objects

- S3 Methods from `dplyr` will not work on `DataFrame` objects
- Some equivalents exist (most pre-date the `tidyverse`)
    + `subset()` pre-dates `dplyr::filter()`
    + `rbind()` and `combineRows()` $\implies$ `bind_rows()`
    + `cbind()`, `combineCols()` and `merge()` $\implies$ `joins`
    + `sort()` $\implies$ `arrange()`
    + `unique()` $\implies$ `distinct()`
- No simple equivalent for `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `across()`, `pivot_*()`


## `DataFrame` objects
    
- Can have columns of lists (so can `tbl_df` objects)
    - e.g. a `CharacterList()` from `IRanges`
    - `S4` lists can be *typed* $\implies$ memory efficiency
    - `List` objects can exist in a compressed form $\implies$ memory efficiency
- `DataFrame` objects can have `S4` objects as columns
    - `S3` data frames (including tibbles) *cannot*
    
::: {.notes}
By typing a list we only need to record the type once, instead of once for each element.
Can make a big difference with large objects
:::


## `DataFrame` objects

```{r}
library(IRanges)
genes <- c("A", "B")
transcripts <- CharacterList(
  c("A1", "A2", "A3"), c("B1", "B2")
)
transcripts
```

. . .

```{r}
DF <- DataFrame(Gene = genes, Transcripts = transcripts)
DF
```

. . .

```{r}
library(extraChIPs)
as_tibble(DF)
```


## `DataFrame` objects

- Object-level metadata can be added to `DataFrame` objects
- Must be a `list`

```{r}
metadata(DF) <- list(details = "Created for RAdelaide 2024")
glimpse(DF)
```

. . .

- Notice where rownames are and how the "columns" are stored

::: {.notes}
Point out the `@` structure
:::

## `DataFrame` objects

- Also enable the addition of *column-specific metadata* $\implies$ `mcols()`
    + Used heavily in Bioconductor

```{r}
mcols(DF) <- DataFrame(meta =  c("Made-up genes", "Made-up transcripts"))
mcols(DF)
```

. . .

```{r}
glimpse(DF) # This is in the @elementMetadata slot
```



## `S4` Object Structure

- `S4` objects have *slots* denoted with `@`
    + Subtly different to list *elements*
- These are fixed and mandatory for every `S4` class
    + Can still be empty (`NULL`) objects
    + Can be `S3` or `S4` objects
- Enforces a strict structure with checks *as objects formed*
    + Saves time performing checks within functions
    + Makes structure strict, rigid & hard to break

::: {.notes}
S3 objects are easy to break. Just change the class attribute...
:::

## `S4` Object Structure

- We can't `lapply` our way through these objects
- Can access each slot using shortcuts `object@slotName`
    + More formally using `slot(object, "slotName")`
    
::: {.columns}
   
::: {.column}

```{r}
DF@listData
```

:::

::: {.column}


```{r}
slot(DF, "listData")
```

:::

:::
    
## `S4` Object Structure
    
- Slot names can be found using `slotNames(object)`

```{r}
slotNames(DF)
```

. . .

- The full type description can also be found

```{r}
getSlots("DFrame")
```

## `S4` Methods

- `S3` method dispatch uses the `method.class` syntax
- `S4` is very different but has some similarities

. . .

- `S4` objects almost always have hierarchical classes
    + Increasingly common for `S3` objects
    + Each level *extends* the lower level class
    
. . .    
    
- Methods are strictly defined by package authors
    + A `Generic` function must be defined for each method/class
    + The hierarchy is traversed until a method is found

## `S4` Methods

- To check the class hierarchy of an object use `is()` 

```{r}
is(DF)
```

. . .

- Logical tests can be applied

```{r}
is(DF, "DataFrame")
is(DF, "data.frame")
```

. . .

``` r
methods(class = "DataFrame")
```

## `S4` Methods

- The function `body()` will return `standardGeneric()`
    + Slightly different to `UseMethod()`

. . .

- To show code within a function

```{r}
getMethod(f = "nrow", signature = "DataFrame")
```


## Recap

- The Bioconductor Project extends back to the early days of `R`
    + Also the early days of bioinformatics
    + Has a genuine community aspect
. . .


- `S4` object classes are common
    + Foundational classes enabling package inter-operability
    + Much less common in `CRAN` packages (spatial/GIS)
- Method dispatch is handled differently

. . .

- Can play badly with the `tidyverse`
    + An area of active development
